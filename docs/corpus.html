  The documents that I have chosen are "The Most Dangerous Game", "Leiningen versus the Ants", and "Sorry, Wrong Number".
  I found these enjoyable to read and grouped them for comparison because they follow similar premises.
  The plots revolve around the protagonist being put to the test, facing a formidable adversary and having to survive with the best of their abilities and the available tools around them.

   One of the notable clusters that interested me was "of the". This word combination usually had KWIC that were from parts of the story that had the most action occurring.
   From reading some of the snippets of the KWIC for "The Most Dangerous Game", several pieces of the context indicate the protagonist, Rainford,
   is being hunted by a famous hunter known as Zaroff. Zaroff is implied to be very rich and dangerous, as he owns a private island which he uses solely to hunt people that have landed onto his island. 
   It is loaded with various traps to make survival even more challenging, with obstacles such as quicksand and his own hunting dogs appearing frequently in the text. The setting creates a very tense situation as a result, 
   for Rainford is on a race against the clock to survive and escape the island before he becomes a hunter's trophy.

   "Leiningen versus the Ants" has one of the most notable words being "ant", as ants are the very challenge Leiningen faces against. 
   Using the word to examine KWIC, the text shows that the ants are shown not to be underestimated,for they possess a vast array of skills.
    The ants were constantly being underestimated by some characters in the story and they would soon regret it. 
   From examinination, I assume an individual named Leiningen along with other people attempt to prevent a swarm of ants from reaching a ditch and eating their crops. 
   I was surprised with the ability of the ants, as they were very capable of reaching that ditch and most likely were going to if Leiningen wasn't there. He develops good plans that are able to stop them efficiently.
   The story follows a similar premise with the "The Most Dangerous Game", of having to beat a great adversary, but the enemy is very different. It is a huge swarm of insects rather than a singular human.
   Leiningen is also quite different from Rainford, using his wits rather than survival skills to efficiently beat the enemy before they can even reach him or his crops.

   Unlike the previous two texts, the protagonist doesn't use much of her wits, instead relying on her phone and the availability of law enforcement to find and defeat her adversary. I used the term "operator",
   as they are the one of the characters that frequently appear, due to the the plot being mostly Mrs. Stevenson constantly calling them to help her take care of the mysterious person that called her. 
   From the KWIC, it seems that a woman named Mrs. Stevenson is having constant trouble finding an available operator to take the case of finding a mysterious killer that
   has accidentally called her. She is shown to be increasingly desperate as her calls fail multiple times to reach the police. It is a very ominous setting;
   The adversary she faces does not show themselves, only appearing in the phone call to state that she will be in big trouble coupled with the fact that the police strangely won't accept her calls.
