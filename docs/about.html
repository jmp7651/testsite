   <p>Made during a game jam with a theme centered around cloning objects, where I made usage of a clone function in Unity to infinitely generate fruits that the player must catch. A very simple game based on mobile games where you collect items falling from the sky with a basket. You play as a cube collecting fruits that are falling out of the tree, but must avoid the nuts that appear and attempt to taint your basket! Most assets created by me.</p>

   <p>My first game made in a game jam. Was made for a game jam themed about rain, but did not finish making it in time. In this game, you are a member of a tribe who is suppose to kill animals that spawn around the map and gain enough favor from the gods for rain to be summoned. However, the rain part was never finished and only the core gameplay of sacrificing animals for points is unfortunately the only goal. Serves as a reminder that games need to be simple but innovative in a game jam.</p>
