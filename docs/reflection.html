  <h1 id="header">My Experience Developing a Website â€“ GitHub vs. WordPress</h1>
  <hr/>
  <p>
   For someone that has already had some experience with HTML5 and CSS, I would say the most significant challenges for new learner would be how to customize certain elements to your liking, and setting reasonable goals that you can achieve.
   It can be confusing at first on how to change specific elements in a certain fashion, but with enough research this can be overcome.  Sometimes my creativity would cause me to attempt to create an advanced design and it would lead to a dead end with my current level of knowledge, so I had to simplify some elements to ensure proper time management.

   There are several benefits from using GitHub over WordPress and vice versa. 
   The usage of GitHub Pages allows for all sorts of creativity to be input into your site and it lasts indefinitely within GitHub.
   Meanwhile, WordPress allows you to create a well-designed website in a matter of minutes, with various themes and customization choices you can choose from all with a simple click of a button. You can also preview the pages quickly.

   These sites do have some challenges, however. 
   WordPress has a limited design, as it seems you can only choose design choices from the theme presets they have given you and mostly limited to just changing color of the themes. 
   They also have a copious amount of settings, which can be very confusing if you are new to WordPress and do not know how they function. Meanwhile in GitHub Pages, it was difficult to choose from the various choices I could apply on my site due to the unlimited creativity you are given. Applying elements with what I desired was also a challenge, as sometimes it would mess up the page format. The process to preview the pages constantly was also tedious.

   For necessary skills, I think the only skill you really need to use WordPress efficiently is learning what each button does when you are creating and customizing a website. 
   Meanwhile for GitHub, you would need a necessary understanding of HTML5 language and CSS to make websites efficiently.

   A skill I should learn to improve this website is probably more components of the HTML5 and ensuring a good design. 
   Both methods use HTML5 to an extent and improving on that will allow more options to apply your creativity. Making sure a website has good design is also important, as good design makes sure the viewer stays on the page and get your attention.
